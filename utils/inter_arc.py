def interp_arc(points, t=1000):
    r'''
    Linearly interpolate equally-spaced points along a polyline, either in 2d or 3d.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : List
        List of shape (N,2) or (N,3), representing 2d or 3d-coordinates.
    t : array_like
        Number of points that will be uniformly interpolated and returned.

    Returns
    -------
    array_like  
        Numpy array of shape (N,2) or (N,3)
